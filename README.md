# README

There are three main models in this project:
* `User` - can create an account, log in to the account using a mobile phone number and password, log out of the account.
* `Role`-
- `Admin` - Can perform any CRUD operation on any resource,
- `Patient` - Can create and read visits. Can read own appointments, 
- `Doctor` - Can read visits. Can create, read and update own appointments
* `Visit` - planned as a record of the patient for an appointment with a doctor (Model `Appointment`, as a result of the interaction of the `Patient` and the `Doctor`, will be created later)
* gem `devise` used for user authentication
* gem `cancancan` for user authorization
- The pages provide different interfaces and access rights for users with different roles
- Added several navigation links to the title according to the administrator's access rights
